# Hello there! üëã
My name is √Ålvaro Torralba, I'm a young programmer interested in [various topics](#things-i-like) (and Minecraft!)

### I'm currently working on...
 + [@MCPI-Devs](https://github.com/MCPI-Devs)! An organization full of useful and fun Minecraft Pi mods and related programs. An awesome community too üòÑ
 + [craft-engine](https://github.com/craft-devs/craft-engine): A fork of [@code-dot-org](https://github.com/code-dot-org)'s Minecraft-like engine.
 + And some low-level graphics stuff for Linux... :eyes:

Some of my personal repos are active or updated semi-regulary too.

### I'm currently learning...
 + How the whole [DRM/KMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Manager) and [Mesa3D](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa) architecture works.
 + Haskell (really slowly).

### I would like to learn...
Rust, someone convinced me to learn it in a future...

### Things I like...
C, Python, Linux, web technologies (JS, HTML5, CSS, WebAssembly) and derivates (JSON, Node.js). Sometimes I see a random project or learn about some technology and say _"woah, this is really interesting"_, but I don't remember them all, so check my starred repos for a complete list. I also enjoy reading books and watching (the first six) Star Wars movies a lot :smile:

### Fun fact
